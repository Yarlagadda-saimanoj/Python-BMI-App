# Python BMI Calculator

The Python BMI Calculator is a simple command-line application that calculates Body Mass Index (BMI) based on user input of their height and weight in metric units. BMI is a measure of body fat based on height and weight, and it is commonly used to classify people into different weight categories. This project provides a useful tool to quickly and easily calculate a user's BMI based on their input data.

This project is a great example of how Python and Streamlit can be used to build interactive and user-friendly applications for health tracking and fitness monitoring.

## Installation

Before using this application, you must have Python 3 installed on your system. You can download and install Python 3 from the official website

Once you have Python 3 installed, you can clone the repository or download the source code as a zip file and run the file in the machine using your prefered workspace like VsCode, PyCharm etc.

The formula used for the BMI calculation is as follows:

```bash
  BMI = weight / (height ** 2)

```  
The resulting BMI value is then classified using the following categories:
   | BMI Category | 	BMI Range    |
   | :-------- | :------- |
   | `Underweight` | `	< 18.5` |
   | `Normal weight` | `18.5 - 24.9` |
   | `Overweight` | `25 - 29.9` |
   | `Obese` | `>= 30` |
